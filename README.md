Project developed for Microsoft code.fun.do hackathon 2018

## Part 1: Earthquake management system
* A distributed IOT based solution for earthquake detection and early warning system
* Using Raspberry Pi as a central Hub for multiple IOT solutions and Node MCU units deployed in different rooms of a given building providing real time data to the central hub through API calls.
* The central hub is connected to Azure through REST API calls to provide a dashboard monitoring system and as an early warning system. 
* The central hub is responsible for following safety protocols such as
    * Kill the Power and gas supply to prevent further hazard to people.
    * Sound based warning system.
    * Keep track of number of people inside to ensure everyone left the building.
   
## Part 2: Skin disease prediction after Floods
* Using Custom Vision service of Azure cognitive services to predict different type of skin disesase which may arise during a flood scenario.
* The accompanying Android App communicates with Custom Vision service through REST API calls.
    * Eliminates the need Medical Test when there is lack of infrastructure during a calamity.
